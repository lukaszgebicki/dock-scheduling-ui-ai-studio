## Active and queued

### UI-MVP-ADMIN-IMPORT-1 — local Friday PO import preview

- State: `READY`.
- Risk class: Class B.
- Objective: implement an Administrator-only local upload and deterministic
  preview of the approved Friday PO/SKU file without applying any changes to
  appointments, planning state or warehouse capacity.
- Product authority: the approved UI MVP and weekly-planning specification
  import contract, together with existing PO identity, `deliveryPartKey`,
  booking, calendar, scope and configuration rules.
- Access boundary: only an authorized Administrator in the applicable warehouse
  scope may open the import route or select a file. Supplier, Operator and
  Security actors fail closed and receive no file contents or diagnostics.
- Input boundary: accept only the explicitly supported local demonstration file
  shape and size. Missing headers, unknown required columns, invalid values,
  duplicate headers, malformed rows and ambiguous identities fail closed with
  stable, line-specific evidence.
- Preview boundary: classify every parsed row deterministically as valid,
  invalid, duplicate or unmatched. Multi-line PO evidence remains grouped by PO
  identity and `deliveryPartKey`; the preview must not create one appointment
  per SKU line.
- Reconciliation boundary: existing bookings and slots remain unchanged. The
  preview may identify an exact match or a reconciliation conflict but must not
  silently merge, split, move, cancel, approve, enrich or overwrite any record.
- Visibility boundary: file names and approved business fields may be shown to
  authorized Administrators. Raw technical stack traces, browser paths,
  secrets and hidden lineage remain absent from the UI.
- Implementation boundary: implement only local file selection, deterministic
  parse/validation, preview grouping, reconciliation evidence and focused tests.
  Do not implement apply/import commit, SKU enrichment, unmatched scheduling,
  lifecycle or gate actions, notifications, reporting, persistence, backend or
  integrations.
- Contract gate: execution requires a separate machine-readable Class B issue
  contract bound to the exact `main` SHA produced by merge of this activation
  PR, plus an external worktree, complete validation, independent review and
  controlled publication.
- Technical boundary: frontend-only local or in-memory scope; no localStorage,
  sessionStorage, IndexedDB, network APIs, deployment or production-repository
  access.

`UI-MVP-WEEKLY-PLANNING-1`, lifecycle and gate consumers,
`UI-MVP-LIST-DETAILS-1`, `UI-MVP-REPORTING-1` and all remaining source tasks
remain inactive and unauthorized. No other product, governance, security or
infrastructure task is `READY` or active.
